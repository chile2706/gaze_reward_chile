Many people feel very frustrated by being unable to be precise in asking Alexa for specific information, as it does not understand people’s slang or syntax very well, and it gets frustrated quickly and stops responding to questions.

They also worshipped many different gods, in a way that fits with “Hellenic” - one of the most well-known was the “Hellenic polytheism”, the worship of many different gods.

These are called cranks. When you move the pedals, the back wheels are forced to turn along with them.  \nSome bicycles have brakes, and others do not.

You know when someone is snoring, that means that their breathing is a bit uneven.  Typically the mouth closes up, causing the air in the nose to warm and humidify, while it is also flowing downwards.  Some air must escape out of the nose, but it also has to flow back into the mouth to get oxygen, so it kind of squishes in there - but eventually it'll find its way out.  That causes the pressure to build up, which causes the snoring sound.  In someone with a cold or allergies it can also cause extra mucus, which sticks together and further obstructs breathing.  Snoring is generally an issue of nasal ventilation, but it can be caused by a lot of other things too - most commonly by congestion in the airways, but also by sinuses, vocal cords, and the tongue.
